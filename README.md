# History
The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. ... After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed. Basketball was here for a very long time and everyone loved the sport

# Plans for Future Development
What I would do is to show the kids videos of how good theses players are and I would also build
different Thing to remember the players by such as building monuments and when they go online they can
also learn the players moves and they can even learn there shooting pattern.
